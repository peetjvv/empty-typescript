# Empty TypeScript

This is just a super basic starter repo for any Typescript application. Comes with everything you need to run a .ts file. You just need to:

1. Ensure you have `node` and a package manager like `npm` / `pnpm` / `yarn` set up.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Make your code changes in the `app.ts` file.

4. Run your changes:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
